# Seed-Grading-System
This system aims to identify the healthy seeds that are fit for cultivation to help farmers with better yield using image processing techniques.

# Overview
This application aims to automate the seed grading equipment and manual grading technique used stereotypically by using MATLABin combination with Region Grow image segmentation method and Edge Masking to identify the good quality seeds from the damaged ones which would increase the crop yield rate.
